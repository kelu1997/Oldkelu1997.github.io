# Death Count and Mortality Rate
![Death Count and Mortality Rate](MortalityRate.png)<br/>

In this visualization, the height of each condition and size reflects the number of deaths (with higher position in the Y axis representing a higher death count) and the area covered by each condition scaled to the death count to give easy relative comparison between conditions with numerical values included in the legend for reference. Lastly, the darkness of the red hue of  each condition represents an increasing mortality rate going lightest to darkest being the most deadly. 


# Case Count vs Death Count
![Case Count vs Death Count](DeathCount.png)<br/>

In this visualization, each conditionâ€™s number of cases is represented by the size of the sphere, with the outer sphere being case count and color hue corresponding to mortality rate, while the inner sphere corresponds to death count giving a good visualization of the proportion rather than a pure numerical percent. 

# Covid vs Influenza Symptom Comparison
![Covid vs Influenza Symptom Comparison](CovidProfileSort.png)<br/>

In this visualization, we compared symptom sensitivity between COVID19 and influenza to analyze and compare the percentage of positively tested patients that have certain symptoms.

# Covid Symptom Presence In Other Major Dieseases Comparison
![Covid Symptom Presence In Other Major Dieseases Comparison](Figure_2.png)<br/>

In this visualization, we compare COVID symptom profiles with other major medical conditions based merely on the presence or absence of certain symptoms found in COVID19. The rightmost bar displays COVID19 and it's symptoms and all the colored bars for each individual symptom (headache, fever,etc). This provides a good visualization of the degree of similarity between COVID and the other diseases we our project compared it to.
