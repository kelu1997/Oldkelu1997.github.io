Casual theories are the belief in and association of causation to two things that may or may not even have a correlational relationship between the two. Depending on the circumstances one could argue superstitions are a form of casual theories. An example of this would be my mom’s belief in not opening an umbrella while inside, if you do this and something negative where to occur rather than looking at all the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the event she would simply attribute it to the opening of the umbrella inside. In a way this phenomenon likely often correlates with a self-fulfilling prophecy in that should you attribute something to another thing for example doing good on a test with eating a “lucky breakfast” that morning before the test you might be so preoccupied with the thought of missing your lucky breakfast and the believed effects from that that you will in fact perform worse on the test due to your own beliefs, Of course then reinforcing in your mind the truth behind the causation effect underlying your causal theory. These kind of intertwined self-fulfilling prophecy and casual theories that give rise to them are likely nearly every day occurrences in the lives of most of us. We just don’t even notice them because we all have our daily routines that we keep to and likely only occasionally slip up such as getting the wrong order for breakfast or missing out on your coffee because you were running late to work.
